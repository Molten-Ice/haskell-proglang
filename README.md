## Programming Language

A code interpreter for a programming language. The language uses lambda-calculus style evaluation and Megaparsec parser combinators for its parser. This means it supports:
- Variables
- Lambda expressions (anonymous functions)
- Functions as values
- Let expressions
- Integer literals
- Currying
